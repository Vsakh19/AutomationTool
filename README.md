# AutomationTool
### https://github.com/Vsakh19/AutomationTool
  Chrome extension that allows user to collect data from Facebook and Openland.  
  ## Facebook
  AutomationTool can collect posts from users page up to chosen date, save them to IndexedDB and create a local feed page where sorted by date posts will appear.
  ## Openland
  AutomationTool saves chats' users and their data to IndexedDB and forms a table on the local page where all information from database will be displayed. Extension can also send messeges to chosen/all users from the table.  
    
    User guide:
    1. Download extension
    2. Install it by clicking "Download an unpacked extension" button at browsers' extensions page (make sure you entered developers mode)
    3. AutomationTool only works on Facebook or Openland, so you have to open one of them depending on what you intend to do.
    4. Insert a list of profile links divided by a line break and pick a date. The   extension will collect posts from these users up to chosen date (for Facebook p.s. works both on old and new Facebook designs).
